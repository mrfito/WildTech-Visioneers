# WildTech-Visioneers  WHAT IS THE NAME THAT WE REGISTERED AT THE END WITH THIS REPO?
This is the GitHub repository for a solution created by team WildTech-Visioneers during the 2023 O'Reilly Architectural Kata. It contains a proposed architecture for Wildlife.ai project for open-source wildlife camera that will enable more efficient species conservation efforts worldwide.


## Overview

Wildlife Watcher

[Wildlife.ai](https://wildlife.ai/), a charity using AI to accelerate wildlife conservation, wants to build an open-source wildlife camera that gets triggered based on the movement of target animals, identifies the species on the device and reports the observation in near real-time to biologists, enabling more efficient species conservation efforts worldwide.

### Users
Biologists and nature enthusiasts (hundreds).

### Requirements
- Users should be able to communicate with the camera using a mobile app (to set the cameras on/off and adjust settings without opening the cameras)
- Users should be able to analyze the videos using common camera trap labelling platforms [(Wildlife Insights](https://wildlifeinsights.org/), [TrapTagger](https://wildeyeconservation.org/traptagger) or [Trapper](https://gitlab.com/trapper-project/trapper))
- Users should be able to publish frames from the videos to iNaturalist for experts to help with the identification of the species
- Users should be able to easily train edge models, using their own labelled videos, and upload the models to the cameras (maybe using third party services like [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/), [Edge Impulse](https://edgeimpulse.com/) or [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite))
- Users should be able to publish the species occurrences to [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) using the [Camtrap DP](https://tdwg.github.io/camtrap-dp/), [data exchange format](https://tdwg.github.io/camtrap-dp/)
- Cameras should be able to process the footage on the device and send a small alert message to the users via LoraWan, 3G or satellite

### Additional Context
The camera hardware will be a combination of ultra-low-power microcontrollers (up to 512KB Flash) and interchangeable modules (e.g. optical sensor, IR lights, transceiver module, batteries) enclosed in a watertight and 3D printed enclosure.

The API for the specific camera hasn’t been selected, allowing teams to specify what behavior they might need from the hardware, helping the team choose appropriate hardware.

## Preliminary phase
Before proposing an architecture, a comprehensive understanding of the organization, its context, and its capabilities is essential

Wildlife.ai (from website)
- charitable trust that uses artificial intelligence to accelerate wildlife conservation.
- works with grassroots wildlife conservation projects and develop open-source solutions using machine learning.
- organises community events, seminars and educational activities to build and maintain machine learning solutions to reduce the current rate of species extinction.
### Our purpose
To ensure artificial intelligence is widely applied to protect biodiversity.
### Other projects
[Wildlife Watcher](https://wildlife.ai/projects/wildlife-watcher/) A wildlife camera that records animals and uses AI to identify them
[Spyfish Aotearoa](https://wildlife.ai/projects/spyfish-aotearoa/) A citizen science and machine learning approach to identify fish in baited underwater videos
[Pepeketua ID](https://wildlife.ai/projects/pepeketua-id/) A pattern recognition software that facilitates the individual identification of Pepeketua, New Zealand endemic frogs.
[Nesher Bari](https://wildlife.ai/projects/nesher-bari/) Using data analytics to boost the protection of griffon vultures.
[Koster Observatory](https://wildlife.ai/projects/koster-observatory/) A machine learning and citizen science approach to analyse underwater footage from Sweden’s first marine national park.

Most of these projects involve machine vision, open-source systems that rely on AI, and machine learning to track, identify, or study wildlife. Moreover, the projects can be considered the building blocks for this new project since they represent proof of concepts of several feautues. The success of these projects indicates that Wildlife.ai is well-prepared to embark on an initiative that leverages its existing capabilities and expands them with multiple integrations 

## Architecture Vision
### Architecture Project
This project garners the support of Wildlife Executive Director, Victor Anton, and Board member Joshua Yellin, ensuring the executive backing necessary for a project of this magnitude within the Wildlife organization.
### Stakeholders, Concerns, and Business Requirements
- Biologists: These stakeholders are keen to embrace new technologies that can aid their work in wildlife conservation. They have concerns about the costs and the learning curve associated with adopting new solutions. User-friendly solutions are strongly preferred.
- Enthusiasts: Those who harbor a genuine curiosity for wildlife are eager to engage with the project. However, they are also sensitive to financial considerations and the effort involved. The accessibility and user-friendliness of the system are of paramount importance to them.
- Wildlife.ai: As a charitable trust dedicated to using artificial intelligence for the acceleration of wildlife conservation, Wildlife.ai places utmost importance on the funding and success of projects, as they are pivotal to the organization's mission and its future.
###  Assumptions
- Internet Access Uncertainty: Internet access cannot be guaranteed in the locations where the cameras will operate. This presents a significant challenge as the system needs to function in remote or potentially off-grid areas, where connectivity may be limited or unreliable.
- Financial Constraints: There are budgetary constraints on the project. Financial limitations necessitate cost-effective solutions and careful allocation of resources to ensure the project's sustainability and success.
- Limited User Base: The user base comprises only a few hundred users. Given this relatively small user community, deploying and maintaining a hosted solution could prove burdensome and financially inefficient. It is more practical to assume that mobile devices possessed by the users have sufficient processing power and internet connectivity to handle essential tasks like data uploading and remote camera control.
- Camera: The project takes advantage of the existing Wildlife.ai project, Wildlife Watcher, and assumes that its camera will be utilized. Furthermore, it establishes minimum hardware and software specifications for this camera.
